# SARS-CoV-2 Origin Study
A bioinformatics project studying the similarities of several common animal coronaviruses' RNA sequence to the first sequenced SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome using the Levenshtein Distance algorithm.  

## Results
Of the various animals tested, pangolins and bats seem to be the only likely animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 tested, with the data pointing moreso towards the former. For more information, the full report has been made available and can be referenced [here](https://andylabs.org/static/media/SARS-CoV-2-Origin-Study.pdf).
